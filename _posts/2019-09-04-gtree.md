[gtree](skranz.github.io/gtree) is a new R package that allows to specify extensive form games using stages, similar as one specifies economic experiments with [ztree](https://www.ztree.uzh.ch/en.html) or [otree](https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 


Let us specify a simple ultimatum game in gtree. A proposer can offer the responder between 0 and 10 Euros. If the responder accepts the offer, the proposer keeps 10 Euro minus the proposed amount. If the responder rejects, both get nothing. 

```r
library(gtree)
game = new_game(
  gameId = "Ultimatum_Dictator",
  options = make_game_options(verbose=FALSE),
  params = list(numPlayers=2,cake=10),
  stages = list(
    stage("proposerStage",
      player=1,
      actions = list(
        action("offer",~0:cake)
      )
    ),
    stage("responderStage",
      player=2,
      observe = c("offer"),
      actions = list(
        action("accept",c(FALSE,TRUE))
      )
    ),
    stage("payoffStage",
      compute=list(
        payoff_1 ~ ifelse(accept, cake-offer,0),
        payoff_2 ~ ifelse(accept, offer,0)
      )
    )
  )
)
```

The following code solves for all pure strategy subgame perfect equilibria and shows the outcomes.

```r
game %>%
  game_solve() %>%
  eq_outcomes() %>%
  select(eqo.ind,offer, accept, payoff_1, payoff_2)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 5
##   eqo.ind offer accept payoff_1 payoff_2
##     <int> <int> <lgl>     <dbl>    <dbl>
## 1       1     1 TRUE          9        1
## 2       2     0 TRUE         10        0
```

We have two different equilibrium outcomes: the proposer either offers 0 or 1 and in both equilibrium outcomes the offer will be accepted.

The function `eq_tables()` also shows us the behavior off the equilibrium path: 

```r
game %>%  eq_tables() 
```

```
## $offer
## # A tibble: 2 x 2
##   offer eq.inds
##   <int> <chr>  
## 1     0 2      
## 2     1 1      
## 
## $accept
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   accept eq.inds
##   <lgl>  <chr>  
## 1 FALSE  1      
## 2 TRUE   2      
## 3 TRUE   1,2
```
We see that all offers above 0 are always accepted, and the two equilibria differ by whether an offer of 0 is accepted or rejected.

In behavioral economics the ultimatum game is often used to illustrate that many people have *social preferences* that go beyond the maximization of own payoffs only. One simple form of social preferences is [inequality aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequity_aversion) (Fehr & Schmidt, 1999) The following code solves the game assuming inequality averse preferences with an envy parameter of `alpha=0.5` but no guilt (`beta=0`). This means the effective utility function of both players are given by
    
    `u_1 = payoff_1 - 0.5*max(payoff_2-payoff_2,0)`
    `u_2 = payoff_2 - 0.5*max(payoff_1-payoff_1,0)`
    

```r
game %>%
  game_set_preferences(pref_ineqAv(alpha=0.5, beta=0)) %>%
  game_solve() %>%
  eq_tables()
```

```
## $offer
## # A tibble: 1 x 2
##   offer eq.inds
##   <int> <chr>  
## 1     3 1      
## 
## $accept
## # A tibble: 11 x 3
## # Groups:   offer [11]
##    offer accept eq.inds
##    <int> <lgl>  <chr>  
##  1     0 FALSE  1      
##  2     1 FALSE  1      
##  3     2 FALSE  1      
##  4     3 TRUE   1      
##  5     4 TRUE   1      
##  6     5 TRUE   1      
##  7     6 TRUE   1      
##  8     7 TRUE   1      
##  9     8 TRUE   1      
## 10     9 TRUE   1      
## 11    10 TRUE   1
```

Now we have a unique equilibrium in which the proposer offers 3 and every offer below 3 would be rejected.

The internal gtree solver used above is quite limited. It can only compute pure strategy subgame perfect equilibria. To access a much larger set of game theoretic solvers, one can use gtree together with the [Gambit](http://www.gambit-project.org/) command line solvers. The following code uses the [gambit-logit](https://gambitproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools.html#gambit-logit-compute-quantal-response-equilbria) solver to compute a [logit quantal response equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantal_response_equilibrium) (QRE) for the ultimatum game using the previously set inequality aversion preferences:

```r
game %>%
  game_gambit_solve(qre.lambda=2) %>%
  eq_tables()
```

```
## $offer
## # A tibble: 9 x 3
## # Groups:   offer [9]
##   offer       .prob eq.inds
##   <int>       <dbl> <chr>  
## 1     0 0.00000116  1      
## 2     1 0.00000120  1      
## 3     2 0.00000718  1      
## 4     3 0.602       1      
## 5     4 0.353       1      
## 6     5 0.0438      1      
## 7     6 0.000646    1      
## 8     7 0.00000952  1      
## 9     8 0.000000140 1      
## 
## $accept
## # A tibble: 20 x 4
## # Groups:   offer, accept [20]
##    offer accept        .prob eq.inds
##    <int> <lgl>         <dbl> <chr>  
##  1     0 FALSE  1.000        1      
##  2     0 TRUE   0.0000264    1      
##  3     1 FALSE  0.998        1      
##  4     1 TRUE   0.00179      1      
##  5     2 FALSE  0.892        1      
##  6     2 TRUE   0.108        1      
##  7     3 FALSE  0.108        1      
##  8     3 TRUE   0.892        1      
##  9     4 FALSE  0.00179      1      
## 10     4 TRUE   0.998        1      
## 11     5 FALSE  0.0000264    1      
## 12     5 TRUE   1.000        1      
## 13     6 FALSE  0.00000320   1      
## 14     6 TRUE   1.000        1      
## 15     7 FALSE  0.000000388  1      
## 16     7 TRUE   1            1      
## 17     8 FALSE  0.0000000471 1      
## 18     8 TRUE   1            1      
## 19     9 TRUE   1            1      
## 20    10 TRUE   1            1
```

We see how player 1 now makes all offers with positive probabilities but mainly concentrates on offers 3,4 and 5. Interestingly, an offer of 2 is still very unlikely and will be rejected with very high probability.

Gambit has an own [Python interface](https://gambitproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyapi.html) to directly construct the game tree of extensive form games. While it is a matter of taste, I think for many games studied in economic experiments it is simpler to specify stages instead of directly constructing a game tree. For a comparision you can look at a [gtree implementation](https://skranz.github.io/gtree/articles/t04_sender_receiver.html)  of a sender-receiver game whose [Gambit Python interface implementation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gambitproject/gambit/blob/master/contrib/samples/sendrecv.ipynb) is linked as example on the Gambit main page.

## Playing games in the web: Rock Paper Scissors Laser Mirror

[gtreeWebPlay](https://skranz.github.io/gtreeWebPlay/) is a companion package to gtree that helps building simply shiny apps that a allow to play a game. Below I embedded an app to play Rock-Paper-Scissors-Laser-Mirror:

  - Laser beats rock, paper and scissors.

  - Mirror beats laser but is beaten by rock, paper and scissors.

  - Otherwise as usual.

You play agains the population of all previous users. (And the first users play against the equilibrium strategies.) Let us see whether you can beat the crowd:

<h3>Kuhn Poker</h3>

Below is a gtreeWebPlay app that allows you to play a round of [Kuhn Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuhn_poker).
(https://skranz.github.io/gtree/articles/t03_kuhn_poker.html). The deck has only three cards: *Jack*, *Queen* and *Ace* and two players who each get one card after they both put one dollar into the blind. Below is an embedded app that allows you to play it against a randomly chosen earlier player:
