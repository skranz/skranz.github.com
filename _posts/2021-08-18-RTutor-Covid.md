An [earlier post](http://skranz.github.io/r/2021/03/22/tracktherecovery.html) described the [impressive collection of US data](https://github.com/OpportunityInsights/EconomicTracker) that Chetty et al. made available to illuminate the economic impacts of Covid and accompanying policy measures.

As part of her Master thesis at Ulm university Alexandra Aehle has created a very nice [RTutor](https://github.com/skranz/RTutor) problem set that allows you to replicate key insights of the data base the [related working paper](https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tracker_paper.pdf) in an interactive fashion. Like in previous RTutor problem sets, you can enter free R code in a web-based shiny app. The code will be automatically checked and you can get hints how to proceed. 

You can test the problem set online on shinyapps.io

[https://alexaehle.shinyapps.io/RTutorEconomicImpactsOfCOVID19](https://alexaehle.shinyapps.io/RTutorEconomicImpactsOfCOVID19)

or locally install the problem set, by following the installation guide at the problem set's Github repository:
